fMRI pipeline Feature Model
===

# About

The goal of this work is to model analytic variability in fMRI pipelines as a Feature Model (FM),
and to use such FM to explore and sample the fMRI analytic space.

# Feature Model

The goal of an FM is to represent the allowed combination of feature in a given software system.
A feature is an increment in a system functionality, that offer a configuration option. 
Some combination of feature can be allowed or forbidden, and such constraints are included in FMs.

For this work, we choose to use the [Universal Variability Language (UVL)](https://universal-variability-language.github.io/) (Sundermann et al., 2021).
